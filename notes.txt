1. Minimal instructions for reviewers to understand the submitted files
    1. Creating Pt_111 slab surface
    2. Add CO as the reaction material
    3. Created a .traj file and use ASE function add_adsorbate to do reaction and clacualte its energy
    4. import the GPAW and analzye the reaction


2. Links to any relevant files

3. If you are submitting as a group, a brief description of your individual contribution
    I contribute the first presentation and do some analyze by using the GPAW instead of esspco. Also, I do the research of how the DFT function work and write some code to calculate the energy using in the reaction


4. a self-assessment of which goals you achieved and why
    1. Log in pace-ice
    2. Successfully can use the esspco
    3. Creating molecules and slabs in several situation
